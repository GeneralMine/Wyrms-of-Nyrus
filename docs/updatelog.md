## Kollective Update
### 0.3.1

- Wyrms now have a true hivemind system
  - Once any wyrm finds the player, ALL WYRMS AND CREEPED WILL KNOW THEIR TARGET
  - Wyrms will have expanded follow ranges (500 blocks) and only target players unless if attacked by something else
  - Wyrms will forget what player they were targeting if:
    - Attacked by another player
    - Haven't seen original player in a moderate amount of time
    - Targeted player dies
- Potential fix for wyrms randomly enraging
