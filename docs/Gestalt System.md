# THE GESTALT SYSTEM
##### Currently in prototype staging

## INTRODUCTION
The Gestalt System is an AI system in Wyrms and Creeped mobs, and specifically targets players (because having them use this system for literally everything will cause lag and break the mechanic in the player's POV)

Aliens will slowly "gravitate" to a player's general position, depending on a number of factors that change how wyrms & creeped respond and behave.

## INFAMY
Infamy is increased every time a player hurts a wyrm, and slowly decreases every 2 minutes, but *never* hits zero once wyrms know of a player's existence.

So long as infamy is above 0, wyrms will use the Gestalt system, and begin to passively move into a player's general position. Scouter wyrms, of course, will NEVER use the Gestalt system, as they exist to randomly explore the terrain.

The higher infamy is, the faster these aliens will congregate into an area, and the faster evolution will progress as the player kills aliens. When infamy reaches maximum level, a loud, distant screech will play, 5 invasion events take place, and all aliens in the world get special effects based on their type.

### MAX INFAMY EFFECTS
- Creeped:
  - Spreads 2x faster
  - Creeped kills creates 2 mobs, not 1
- Evolution:
  - Evolution decay temporarily disabled
- Invasion:
  - Every countdown tick makes an invasion event happen around the player
